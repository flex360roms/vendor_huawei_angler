    <string name="help_text"><b>What is DSP Manager?</b>
\n\n
DSP Manager is a per-output audio adjustment app. <i>DSP</i> stands for
Digital Signal Processing, and the <i>Manager</i> part refers to the fact that the
DSP is actually not run inside the app itself; the manager can only
enable it for apps which are compliant with Android\'s audio effect
specification, i.e. most music players.
\n\n\n
<b>Philosophy</b>
\n\n
CyanogenMod\'s audio processing supports three different output categories:
wired headset, phone speaker and bluetooth headset. There is a separate
configuration panel for each output category. DSP Manager\'s philosophy is to
correct each audio output\'s particular deficiencies in order to reach the most
optimal listening experience with each.
\n\n
Unlike with AOSP audio effects, there are no per-app settings. This is
a deliberate design choice: it is the output we care about, not which
app generates the audio for DSP Manager to work with.
\n\n\n
<b>Features</b>
\n\n
1. <b>Dynamic range compression (DRC)</b>
\n\n
This effect estimates the loudness of the audio as perceived by an average
listener and drives a gain control based on this estimate. The primary use case
is with noisy environments such as in cars or on street, where quiet parts of
music are in risk of being drowned out by background noise.
\n\n
The sole tunable determines how hard DSP Manager will try to maintain audio
loudness at the target level. There is no AOSP equivalent for this DSP effect.
\n\n\n
2. <b>Bass boost</b>
\n\n
The bass boost is a simple low-pass filter which can be used to add an emphasis
at 55 Hz and lower frequencies. The boost is around 6 dB, and modified by the
\'strength\' parameter, which adds filter resonance at the 55 Hz band, giving
that frequency extra emphasis. The effect is designed to combat loss of bass
frequency common with small speakers and supra-aural headsets which do not
couple tightly with user\'s ear canal.
\n\n\n
3. <b>Equaliser</b>
\n\n
This is a 6-band equaliser with bands at 16, 64, 250, 1000, 4000 and 16000 Hz.
Some common presets are provided, and the frequency response can also be
customised by tapping on the equaliser graph. The effect should be used to tune
the frequency response to user\'s personal taste, or to the particular
capabilities of the available headset or speakers.
\n\n
Equaliser also contains a loudness compensation filter, which equalises the
changes in ear frequency response based on the sound pressure level which
reaches the user\'s ear. Use of a wired headset is required, and the strength
parameter value must be tuned correctly before the effect will work as
designed.
\n\n
To select the right value for the compensation strength, use the quietest music
volume, and choose some wide-spectrum noisy music such as rock or metal. Try
to find a setting where the bass is boosted back into audibility and seems
balanced with the rest of the material. After the compensation has been
correctly configured, bass should remain at the same level relative to the
other instruments regardless of the listening level. On the other hand, if
music starts to sound bass heavy at higher listening levels, the compensation
is probably set too strong, and should be reduced.
\n\n
The compensation is added to the user\'s chosen adjustments. If only compensation
is desired, the equaliser should be left at the \'Flat\' setting.
\n\n\n
4. <b>Headset Filter</b>
\n\n
The headset filter is a crossfeed design inspired by the famous bs2b analogue
circuit. The effect passes mono sound unchanged, and adjusts the difference
signal through a low-pass filter which approximates both head shadow and
interaural delay at once, giving right kind of psychoacoustic clues for user\'s
ears. The intention is to prevent listener fatigue arising from the
implausible stereo separation inherent with all headsets. The effect should be
enabled whenever using stereo headsets.
\n\n
Because the mixing reduces the stereo separation somewhat, there is a
Haas-effect reverb, which can be used to increase the perceived stereo image
width. This is controlled by the \'Room type\' control.</string>
